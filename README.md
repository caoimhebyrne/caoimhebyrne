Hi, **I'm Caoimhe (`she/her`)**, a 18 year-old software developer from Ireland. Currently, I work at [Essential](https://essential.gg), and during my free time, I like to contribute to different open source projects.

I have experience in many programming languages and frameworks, but I mainly spend my time writing code in Java & Kotlin.
